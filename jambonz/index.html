<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>jambonz is a specification for issuing call control commands via JSON payloads over HTTP connections.  These messages are sent from your application in response to web callbacks from a jambonz call control server, and they provide jambonz with your instructions on how to handle a call.  </p>
<p>When an incoming call is received by the platform, jambonz makes an HTTP request to the URL endpoint that is configured for that called number. Outbound calls that are initiated by the REST API are controlled in a similar way -- when invoking the REST API to launch a call, you provide a web callback url and in your response to the subsequent HTTP GET or POST to that url you then return a JSON payload describing the application that should govern the outbound call.</p>
<h2 id="basic-json-message-structure">Basic JSON message structure</h2>
<p>The JSON payload (aka the "application") that you provide in response to a callback must be an array of objects, with each object describing a task that the platform shall perform.  These tasks are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the array.  Each task is identified by a verb (e.g. "dial", "gather", "hangup" etc) with associated detail and these verbs are described in more detail below.</p>
<p>If the caller hangs up during the execution of an application for that call, the current task is allowed to complete and any remaining tasks in the application are ignored.</p>
<p>Through additional callbacks that may be invoked during the execution of an application (typically as a result of those verbs which have an "action" property callback), the current application may be replaced with a new JSON application document.  In such a case, the new document begins executing, and any remaining tasks in the original document are discarded.</p>
<p>Each task object in the JSON array must include a "verb" property that describes the action to take.  Any additional information that the task needs to operate are provided as properties as well, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
  &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hi there!  Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly.&quot;,
  &quot;synthesizer&quot;: {
    &quot;vendor&quot;: &quot;google&quot;,
    &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en-US&quot;,
    &quot;gender&quot;: &quot;FEMALE&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some verbs allow other verbs to be nested; e.g. "gather" can have a nested "say" command in order to play a prompt and collect a response in one command:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;gather&quot;,
  &quot;actionHook&quot;: &quot;/gatherCardNumber&quot;,
  &quot;input&quot;: [&quot;speech&quot;, &quot;dtmf&quot;],
  &quot;timeout&quot;: 16,
  &quot;numDigits&quot;: 6,
  &quot;recognizer&quot;: {
    &quot;vendor&quot;: &quot;google&quot;,
    &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en-US&quot;
  },
  &quot;say&quot;: {
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Please say or enter your six digit card number now&quot;,
    &quot;synthesizer&quot;: {
      &quot;vendor&quot;: &quot;google&quot;,
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en-US&quot;,
      &quot;gender&quot;: &quot;FEMALE&quot;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Altogether then, a simple example application which provides the basics of a voicemail application with transcription would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hi there!  Please leave a message at the tone and we will get back to you shortly.  Thanks, and have a great day!&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;listen&quot;,
    &quot;actionHook&quot;: &quot;http://example.com/voicemail&quot;,
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://ws.example.com&quot;,
    &quot;finishOnKey&quot;: &quot;#&quot;,
    &quot;metadata&quot;: {
      &quot;topic&quot;: &quot;voicemail&quot;
    },
    &quot;mixType&quot;: &quot;mono&quot;,
    &quot;playBeep&quot;: true,
    &quot;timeout&quot;: 20,
    &quot;transcribe&quot;: {
      &quot;transcriptionHook&quot;: &quot;/transcription&quot;
    }
  },
  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Thanks for your message.  We'll get back to you&quot;
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>Hey, did you see what we did there?  It's a voicemail application, but where is the recording url?  How do you retrieve the recording after the call?</p>
<p>There is none, and you don't.</p>
<p>Let's rethink this: </p>
<p>Instead of making a recording -- which exposes your customer's PII since we now have to store sensitive data at rest in the platform -- how's about we instead send you a real-time audio stream over a secure websocket connection while the call is proceeding.  Annotate it with any metadata you need for tracking on your end, and we'll send that along as well.</p>
<p>Thus, you get the audio in real-time and we don't ever store your customer's sensitive data at rest.  Bam. Done.</p>
<h2 id="http-connection-details">HTTP connection details</h2>
<p>Each HTTP request that jambonz makes to one of your callbacks will include (at least) the following information either as query arguments (in a GET request) or in the body of the response as a JSON payload (in a POST request):</p>
<ul>
<li>callSid: a unique identifier for the call, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">uuid</a> format.</li>
<li>applicationSid: a unique identifier for the jambonz application controlling this call</li>
<li>accountSid: a unique identifier for the jambonz account associated with the application</li>
<li>direction: the direction of the call, either 'inbound' or 'outbound'</li>
<li>from: the calling party number</li>
<li>to: the called party number</li>
<li>callerId: the caller name, if known</li>
<li>callStatus: current status of the call, see table below</li>
<li>sipStatus: the most recent sip status code received or generated for the call</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the request <strong>MAY</strong> include</p>
<ul>
<li>parentCallSid: the callSid of a parent call to this call, if this call is a child call</li>
</ul>
<p>And the initial webhook for a new incoming call will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>originatingSipTrunkName: name of the SIP trunk that originated the call to the platform</li>
<li>originatingSipIp: the ip address and port of the sip gateway that originated the call</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you specify to use a POST method for the initial webhook for an incoming call, the JSON payload in that POST will also contain the entire incoming SIP INVITE request details in a 'sip' property (this is not provided if a GET request is used).  This can be useful if you need a detailed look at all of the SIP headers or the Session Description Protocol being offered.</p>
<p>Note also that the information that jambonz sends you with each HTTP request can be augmented by your application by using the <a href="#tag">tag</a> verb.</p>
<p>You may optionally use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic Authentication</a> to protect your endpoints.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="#example-messages">Example messages</a> section to see further details.</p>
<h2 id="initial-state-of-incoming-calls">Initial state of incoming calls</h2>
<p>When the jambonz platform receives a new incoming call, it responds 100 Trying to the INVITE but does not automatically answer the call.  It is up to your application to decide how to finally respond to the INVITE.  You have some choices here.</p>
<p>Your application can:</p>
<ul>
<li>answer the call, which connects the call to a media endpoint that can perform IVR functions on the call,</li>
<li>outdial a new call, and bridge the two calls together (i.e use the dial verb), </li>
<li>reject the call, with a specified SIP status code and reason,</li>
<li>redirect the call (i.e. generating a SIP 302 response back to the caller), or</li>
<li>establish an early media connection and play audio to the caller without answering the call.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last is interesting and worthy of further comment.  The intent is to let you play audio to callers without necessarily answering the call.  You signal this by including an "earlyMedia" property with a value of true in the application.  When receiving this, the jambonz core will create an early media connection (183 Session Progress) if possible, as shown in the example below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: an early media connection will not be possible if the call has already been answered by an earlier verb in the application.  In such a scenario, the earlyMedia property is ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[
  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;say&quot;,
    &quot;earlyMedia&quot;: true,
    &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Please call back later, we are currently at lunch&quot;
    &quot;synthesizer&quot;: {
      &quot;vendor&quot;: &quot;aws&quot;,
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;en-US&quot;,
      &quot;voice&quot;: &quot;Amy&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;sip:decline&quot;,
      &quot;status&quot;: 480,
      &quot;headers&quot;: {
        &quot;Retry-After&quot;: 1800
      }
    }
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>The say, play, gather, listen, and transcribe verbs all support the "earlyMedia" property.  </p>
<p>The dial verb supports a similar feature of not answering the inbound call unless/until the dialed call is answered via the "answerOnBridge" property.</p>
<h2 id="speech-integration">Speech integration</h2>
<p>The platform makes use of text-to-speech as well as real-time speech recognition.  Both google and AWS/Polly are supported for text to speech.  Currently only google is supported for speech to text.</p>
<p>Synthesized audio is cached for up to 24 hours, so that if the same {text, language, voice} combination is requested more than once in that period it will be served from cache, reducing speech synthesis costs.</p>
<p>A JSON service key file containing GCP credentials for cloud speech services must be downloaded and installed on the jambonz feature servers to enable tts and speech recognition for google.  For AWS/Polly, the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_REGION must be provided in the server environments where the <a href="https://github.com/jambonz/jambonz-feature-server">jambonz-feature-server</a> application is running.</p>
<p>As part of the definition of an application, you can set defaults for the language and voice to use for speech synthesis as well as the language to use for speech recognition.  These can then be overridden by verbs in the application, by using the 'synthesizer' and 'recognizer' properties./</p>
<h2 id="webhooks">Webhooks</h2>
<p>Many of the verbs specify a webhook that will be called when the verb completes, or has some information to deliver to your application.  These verbs contain a property that allow you to configure that webhook.  By convention, the property name will always end in "Hook"; e.g "actionHook", "dtmfHook", and so on.</p>
<p>You can either specify the webhook as a simple string specifying a url:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;actionHook&quot;: &quot;https://my.appserver.com/results&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>or a relative url</p>
<pre><code>&quot;actionHook&quot;: &quot;/results&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>In the latter case, the base url of the application will be applied.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can provide an object containing a url (required) and optional method and basic authentication parameters, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;actionHook&quot;: {
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://my.appserver.com/results&quot;,
  &quot;method&quot;: &quot;GET&quot;,
  &quot;username&quot;: &quot;foo&quot;,
  &quot;password&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the verb descriptions below, whenever we indicate a property is a webhook we are referring to this syntax.</p>
<h1 id="supported-verbs">Supported Verbs</h1>
<p>Each of the supported verbs are described below.</p>
<h2 id="conference">conference</h2>
<p>The <code>conference</code> verb places a call into a conference.</p>
<pre><code class="json">  {
    &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;conference&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;test&quot;,

    &quot;waitHook&quot;: &quot;/confWait&quot;,
    &quot;enterHook&quot;: &quot;/confEnter&quot;

<p>Note: A conference bridge belongs to an Account (the Account that is associated with the Application that created the conference), and only calls generated from Applications under that Account can join that conference.  The conference <code>name</code> property should be unique within an Account for different conference bridges; however, the same name can be used by different Accounts and each will refer to different conference bridges on the media servers.</p>
<p>Conference events:</p>
<ul>
<li>'start': the conference has started</li>
<li>'end': the conference has ended</li>
<li>'join': a participant has joined the conference</li>
<li>'leave': a participant has left the conference</li>
<li>'start-talking': a participant started speaking</li>
<li>'end-talking': a participant stopped talking</li>
</ul>
<p>Conference status webhooks will contain the following additional parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>conferenceSid: a unique identifier for the conference</li>
<li>friendlyName: the name of the conference as specified in the application</li>
<li>event: the conference event being reported (e.g. "join")</li>

<p>As the example above illustrates, when you execute the 'dial' command you are making one or more outbound call attempts in an effort to create one new call, which can be bridged to a parent call. The <code>target</code> property specifies an array of call destinations (aka <a href="#target-types">endpoints</a>) that will be attempted simultaneously.  </p>
<p>If multiple endpoints are specified in the <code>target</code> array, all targets are outdialed at the same time (e.g., "simring", or "blast outdial" as some folks call it) and the call will be connected to the first endpoint that answers the call and, optionally, completes a call screening application as specified in the <code>url</code> property.</p>
<p>There are several types of endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>a telephone phone number,</li>
<li>a sip endpoint, identified by a sip uri (and possibly authentication parameters),</li>
<li>a conference, </li>
<li>a webrtc or sip client that has registered directly with your application, or</li>
<li>Microsoft Teams user</li>
</ul>

Dialing to a parking slot allows you to pick up a call that has been parked in that slot.  If the slot is empty, the `dial` verb will return immediate failure.
-->

<p>The <code>confirmHook</code> property that can be optionally specified as part of the target types (with the exception of the <code>park</code> type) is a web callback that will be invoked when the outdial call is answered.  That callback should return an application that will run on the outbound call before bridging it to the inbound call.  If the application completes with the outbound call still in a stable/connected state, then the two calls will be bridged together.</p>
<p>This allows you to easily implement call screening applications (e.g. "You have a call from so-and-so.  Press 1 to decline").</p>

<p>The <em>actionHook</em> webhook will contain the following additional parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dialogflowResult</code>: the completion reason:<ul>
<li><code>redirect</code> - a new application was returned from an event webhook</li>
<li><code>completed</code> - an intent with <code>end iteraction</code> set to true was received from dialogflow</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>eventHook</em> webhook will contain two parameters: <code>event</code> and <code>data</code>.  The <code>event</code> parameter identifies the specific event and the <code>data</code> parameter is an object containng event data associated with the event.  The following events are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>intent</code>: dialogflow detected an intent</li>
<li><code>transcription</code>: a speech transcription was returned from dialogflow</li>
<li><code>dmtf</code>: a dtmf key was pressed by the caller</li>
<li><code>start-play</code>: an audio segment returned from dialogflow started to play</li>

<li><code>no-input</code>: the no input timer elapsed with no input detected from the caller</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="call-transfer">call transfer</h3>
<p>Call transfer from a dialogflow bot is achieved by responding to an eventHook with event <code>intent</code> by returning a new jambonz application containing a <a href="#dial">dial</a> verb.  Of course, this should only be done if the intent is signaling a request for a call transfer.</p>
<p>Indicating a desire to transfer the call to a live agent can be done in a couple of different ways in the dialogflow editor:</p>
<ol>
<li>By adding a Dialogflow Phone Gateway Response to the intent, with a Transfer Call action.  </li>
<li>By adding a custom payload in a response to the intent, with arbitrary JSON content that you define and which should include the telephone number (or registered user, or sip endpoint) to transfer to.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: option 1 only works when transferring to a US number, because the dialogflow editor only accepts US destinations.  To transfer to non-US destinations, use option 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In either case, your application is responsible for having an eventHook that parses the intent (found in the <code>data</code> property of the webhook content) in order to check if call transfer is being requested, and if so responding with a new jambonz application.</p>
<p>For instance, when the Dialogflow Phone Gateway Response is used (option 1 above), the code snippet below shows where to find the transfer number in the intent data provided in the eventHook.</p>
<pre><code>const evt = req.body; 
if (evt.event === 'intent') {
    const qo = evt.data.query_result;
    const transfer = qo.fulfillment_messages.find((fm) =&gt; {
      return fm.platform === 'TELEPHONY' &amp;&amp; fm.telephony_transfer_call;
    });
    if (transfer) {
        // a transfer has been requested
        // transfer.telephony_transfer_call.phone_number has the phone number to transfer to

<p>jambonz does not have a 'record' verb.    This is by design, for data privacy reasons.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Recordings can contain sensitive and confidential information, and such data is never stored at rest in the jambonz core.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, jambonz provides the <strong>listen</strong> verb, where an audio stream(s) can be forked and sent in real-time to a customer application for processing.</p>
<p>The listen verb can also be nested in a <a href="#dial">dial</a> verb, which allows the audio for a call between two parties to be sent to a remote websocket server.</p>
<p>To utilize the listen verb, the customer must implement a websocket server to receive and process the audio.  The endpoint should be prepared to accept websocket connections with a subprotocol name of 'audio.jambonz.org'.  </p>
<p>The listen verb includes a <strong>url</strong> property which is the url of the remote websocket server to send the audio to. The url may be an absolute or relative URL. HTTP Basic Authentication can optionally be used to protect the websocket endpoint by using the <strong>wsAuth</strong> property.</p>
<p>The format of the audio data sent over the websocket is 16-bit PCM encoding, with a user-specified sample rate.  The audio is sent in binary frames over the websocket connection.  </p>
<p>Additionally, one text frame is sent immediately after the websocket connection is established.  This text frame contains a JSON string with all of the call attributes normally sent on an HTTP request (e.g. callSid, etc), plus <strong>sampleRate</strong> and <strong>mixType</strong> properties describing the audio sample rate and stream(s).  Additional metadata can also be added to this payload using the <strong>metadata</strong> property as described in the table below.  Once the intial text frame containing the metadata has been sent, the remote side should expect to receive only binary frames, containing audio.  The remote side is not expected to send any data back over the websocket.</p>

## park

> Not yet implemented

The `park` command is used to park a call at a named parking slot.  Once a call is parked, it can be picked up by another call using the `dial` verb with a target type of 'park'.  The park verb completes when one of the following happens:

- It is picked up by another caller, using the dial verb (and that call subsequently completes).
- It leaves the parking slot due to executing a [leave](#leave) verb.
- It leaves the parking slot due to a timeout.
- The caller hangs up.

Once the park command completes, it optionally calls a configured `actionHook` property (unless the caller has hung up) and executes the application returned, if any.  If no action is specified, it proceeds to execute the next task in the current application.



<pre><code class="json">{
  &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;park&quot;,
  &quot;slot&quot;: &quot;7000&quot;,
  &quot;actionHook&quot;: &quot;/unparked&quot;,
  &quot;waitHook&quot;: &quot;/while-parked&quot;,
  &quot;timeout&quot;: 60
}
</code></pre>


You can use the following options in the `park` command:

| option        | description | required  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| actionHook | a webhook that is invoked when the call leaves the parking slot.  If the call has been bridged to another party, the webhook is invoked when that call is complete. See below for request parameters | no |
| slot | a label for the parking location | yes |
| timeout | number of seconds to wait for pickup before exiting the parking slot | no |
| waitHook | a webhook to call for verbs to execute while parked.  The returned task list may only include play, say, or gather verbs.  Once the task list is completed, the webhook will be called again repeatedly while the call is parked | no |

The `actionHook` request includes the standard request parameters, plus the following:

| property | description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| parkOutcome | the result of the park command, as described below |
| slot | the parking slot used |
| parkTime | the number of seconds the call was parked |

The `parkOutcome` is one of the following:

| value | description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| 'bridged' | The parked call was picked up |
| 'abandoned' | The call was abandoned in park (i.e. the caller hung up) |
| 'left' | the call left the parking slot due to a [leave](#leave) command |
| 'timeout' | the call left the parking slot due to a timeout |

<h2 id="tag">tag</h2>
<p>The tag verb is used to add properties to the standard call attributes that jambonz includes on every action or call status HTTP POST request.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: because of the possible richness of the data, only subsequent POST requests will include this data.  It will not be included in HTTP GET requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose is to simplify applications by eliminating the need to store state information if it can simply be echoed back to the application on each HTTP request for the call.</p>
<p>For example, consider an application that wishes to apply some privacy settings on outdials based on attributes in the initial incoming call.  The application could parse information from the SIP INVITE provided in the web callback when the call arrives, and rather than having to store that information for later use it could simply use the 'tag' verb to associate that information with the call.  Later, when an action or call status triggers the need for the application to outdial it can simply access the information from the HTTP POST body, rather than having to retrieve it from the cache of some sort.</p>
<p>Note that every time the tag verb is used, the collection of customer data is completely replaced with the new data provided.  This information will be provided back in all action or status notifications if POST method is used.  It will appear in property named 'customerData' in the JSON payload. </p>
<pre><code class="json">{
  &quot;verb&quot;: &quot;tag&quot;,
  &quot;data&quot; {
        &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;,

        &quot;list&quot;: [1, 2, &quot;three&quot;]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the above 'tag' verb has executed, web callbacks using POST would have a payload similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;callSid&quot;: &quot;df09e8d4-7ffd-492b-94d9-51a60318552c&quot;,
